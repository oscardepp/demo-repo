My favorite equation 

The Navier-Stokes equation is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics. It describes the motion of fluid substances such as liquids and gases. The equation is derived from the conservation laws of mass and momentum.

The Navier-Stokes equation in its most general form is:

$$ \frac{{\partial \rho}}{{\partial t}} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0 $$

This equation represents the conservation of mass, where ρ is the density of the fluid, t is time, and v is the velocity vector of the fluid.

In addition to the conservation of mass, the Navier-Stokes equation also incorporates the conservation of momentum. It can be written as:

$$\frac{{\partial (\rho \mathbf{v})}}{{\partial t}} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v} \mathbf{v}) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot (\mu (\nabla \mathbf{v} + (\nabla \mathbf{v})^T)) + \rho \mathbf{g}$$

Here, p is the pressure, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and (∇v)^T represents the transpose of the gradient of the velocity vector.

These equations are differential equations that describe the behavior of fluids and are used extensively in the study of fluid dynamics and engineering applications.

## Meine Lieblingsgleichung

This actually isn't my favorite equation. Euler's equation is, which is the following

$$ e^{\pi i } + 1 =0 $$
